                    <p>Computers have become rooted into our lives to depths never imaginable. Tech got to me at a very young age (mostly through gaming). As I got older 
                        the question of how these black boxes made such bright and colourful images became so interesting to me. That is why I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at the 
                        University of Waterloo. Today, I want to use the knowledge that I gain to build innovative technology to help people in their everyday life. From autonomous vehicles 
                        to artificial intelligence to exploring Mars, it's only the beginning for computers,
                        and I want to be a part of that story.

                            <h5>May 2019 - August 2019</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Rebuilt a web application using React and NodeJS from the ground up which helped to manage the cashflow regarding 
                                    internal and external within Scotiabank. 
                                </li>
                                <li>Used various libraries such as Charts.js and reactstrap to create a cash management dashboard on the frontend, while 
                                    the backend used expressjs and an oracle client to connect to the database.
                                </li>
                                <li>Application was deployed using internal CI/CD pipelines onto the cloud.</li>
                                <li>Rewrote and redesigned several components of the original applications which was built in 2002 using Java Struts
                                    into components that were more testable, easy to understand, and overall more maintainable.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Software Developer - Innovation Squad</h4>
                            <h5>September 2018 - December 2018</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Developed a chatbot using <a href="https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js">NLP.js</a>, which 
                                    aggregated trading data allowing equity traders to easily query trading information which
                                    in turn significantly improved their workflow and time to accomplish tasks. Previously, they
                                    had to access three different sites and interpret the data on their own. By automating that 
                                    with a chatbot, we were able to make that process much easier.
                                </li>
                                <li>The bot itself was a full stack web application connecting to various databases with the 
                                    use of internal APIs. The application was designed to be modular and portable by having the 
                                    frontend use pure HTML, CSS, and JS and the backend using Node.JS which was then dockerized.
                                </li>
                                <li>Developed a REST API to connect an existing Oracle database to the chatbot using Node.JS 
                                    and Docker as well
                                </li>
                                <li>Worked in an Agile environment following practices such as test-driven development,
                                    pair programming, daily stand-ups, and regular code reviews
                                </li>

                            <p>This was a new type of event Google held for the first time. It was unique in that it was a coding
                                challenge which took place in several cities across Canada at the same time while we were given
                                access to all of Google Cloud's APIs. I went with my team from Scotiabank and what we did was 
                                prototype a a day planner using the Google Maps API where a user could set multiple destinations
                                and would then receive a suggestion of an optimal route they could take throughout the day.

                                <li>Communicated with hiring managers and business clients to meet their IT needs relating to 
                                    issues with computer usage or the preparation and deployment of a laptop to test new software

                                    when users faced performance issues or had trouble connecting to their monitors I would 
                                    diagnose the issue and resolve it.
