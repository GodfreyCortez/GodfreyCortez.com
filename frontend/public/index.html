            <h1>Who I Am</h1>
            <p>Like many others I watched computers become so entrenched into our lives, on a scale we've never seen before. And like many kids, I explored that tech
                such as through the means of video games and youtube. As I got older the question of what made them work got more and more interesting to me. 
                That is why I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Now, I want to use the knowledge that I gain to build innovative 
                technology to help people in their everyday life. From autonomous vehicles to artificial intelligence to exploring Mars, it's only the beginning for computers,
                and I want to be a part of that story.

                <div>
                    <h2>Scotiabank</h2>
                    <h4>Software Developer - Innovation Squad</h4>
                    <h5>September 2018 - December 2018</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed a chatbot using <a href="https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js">NLP.js</a>, which 
                            aggregated trading data allowing equity traders to easily query trading information which
                            in turn significantly improved their workflow and time to accomplish tasks. Previously, they
                            had to access three different sites and interpret the data on their own. By automating that 
                            with a chatbot, we were able to make that process much easier.
                        </li>
                        <li>The bot itself was a full stack web application connecting to various databases with the 
                            use of internal APIs. The application was designed to be modular and portable by having the 
                            frontend use pure HTML, CSS, and JS and the backend using Node.JS which was then dockerized.
                        </li>
                        <li>Developed a REST API to connect an existing Oracle database to the chatbot using Node.JS 
                            and Docker as well
                        </li>
                        <li>Worked in an Agile environment following practices such as test-driven development,
                            pair programming, daily stand-ups, and regular code reviews
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Google Cloud Relay</h2>
                <h3>December 2018</h3>
                <p>This was a new type of event Google held for the first time. It was unique in that it was a coding
                    challenge which took place in several cities across Canada at the same time while we were given
                    access to all of Google Cloud's APIs. I went with my team from Scotiabank and what we did was 
                    prototype a a day planner using the Google Maps API where a user could set multiple destinations
                    and would then receive a suggestion of an optimal route they could take throughout the day.

                <h3>On Site Support Co-op</h3>
                <h4>January 2018 - April 2018</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communicated with hiring managers and business clients to meet their IT needs relating to 
                        issues with computer usage or the preparation and deployment of a laptop to test new software
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Resolved issues that clients had pertaining to their laptops and corresponding peripherals. For instance,
                        when users faced performance issues or had trouble connecting to their monitors I would 
                        diagnose the issue and resolve it.
